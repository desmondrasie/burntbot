# Shakepong
Shakepong is a Python bot designed to automatically send back swaps from other users participating in the swapping event to acquire a Shakepay Card.

## Requirements
This bot was written with Python 3.6 in mind. This means that I lazily assumed that all dictonaries are ordered. Required Python packages can be found in `requirements.txt` and should be installed prior to running the bot. For ease of access, requirements are listed below:

- Python >= `3.6`
    - `flask`
    - `requests`

These packages can be installed using `pip3`:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
