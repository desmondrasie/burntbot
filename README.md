# Shakepong
Shakepong is a Python bot designed to automatically send back swaps from other users participating in the swapping event to acquire a Shakepay Card.

## Requirements
This bot was written with Python 3.6 in mind. This means that I lazily assumed that all dictonaries are ordered. Required Python packages can be found in `requirements.txt` and should be installed prior to running the bot.

These packages can be installed using `pip3`:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The usage of a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) is recommended.
